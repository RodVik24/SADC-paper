\begin{abstract}
A compact size, 64-channel, 80\,MS/s, 14-bit dynamic range ADC module for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the PANDA experiment was developed and used for testing in various detector readout set-ups \cite{emctdr}. To minimize cabling bulk, the modules are planned to be placed inside the PANDA detector volume, where they will be exposed to magnetic field of up to \SI{2}{\tesla} and a non-negligible radiation flux. The module performs signal filtration, extracts important signal parameters and allows for resolving and parametrizing overlapping pulses. A dual FPGA structure and a hardwired arbitration circuit allows for resolving potentially catastrophic situations caused by radiation-induced (SEU) configuration damages. The FPGAs are prepared for self-detection and recovery from SEU. Processed data are pushed to the optical links running at 2\,Gbit/s. The ADC module is compliant with a “Synchronization Of Data Acquisition” (SODA) System, which allows for obtaining defined latencies with a reference time accuracy of \SI{50}{\pico\second} \cite{konorov}. The paper describes construction details and test environments. The results of performance test, including dynamic range, linearity, magnetic field and preliminary radiation sustainability are also presented.
